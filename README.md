# Simulation_Ne_from_FROH

A set scripts for simulation on estimating recent effective population size (Ne) from Runs of Homozygosity (ROH).

To simulate data run

``` ./1_SimulatePopulation.R Rep Scenario ```

To analyse the data run

``` ./2_AnalysePopulation.R Rep Scenario ```

Note:

* `Rep` is a replicate number
* `Scenario` is one of: Base,  SceA, SceB, SceC, and SceD)
